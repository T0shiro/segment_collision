# kotlin-js-example
Boilerplate for Kotlin 1.1-based JS-projects

This project aims to provide a minimal working Gradle template
for developers targeting the Kotlin 1.1 JS compiler. 
 
It was hard to find a working, up-to-date example, so I decided
to take [this example](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/libraries/examples/browser-example)
and modify it.
1. ``git clone https://github.com/bascan/kotlin-js-example.git`` 
2. ``cd kotlin-js-example`` 
3. ``./gradlew clean build`` 
4. Point your browser to the ``./script/index.html`` file 
 
Do you see ``Some Dynamically Created Content!!!``?
Congratulations! You're all set.

Have fun :-)
