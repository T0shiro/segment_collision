## Methods used to detect collisions

### Naive method : Double for loops
Each frame, we loop on each segment and check if another segment collides with it.

### Optimisation : Quadtree
Each frame, we subdivide the canvas in 4 parts as many times as necessary to have a minimum of segments in each part.
